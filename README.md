2D Fourier Transform of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging raw data

Description coming soon on https://compphys.go.ro

Basically this is a quickly implemented project to test some wrapper classes for FFTW library: http://www.fftw.org/ Obviously, the project needs the FFTW library.

It's a 2D Fourier Transform of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging raw data. It displays both the raw data and the image, allows cutting out low and high frequency information.


It needs the Head2D.dat raw data file one can find here: http://download.nvidia.com/developer/GPU_Gems_2/CD/Index.html in the source tree from Chap. 48, Medical Image Reconstruction with the FFT.
By the way, here is the chapter, in case somebody wants to look over it: https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter48.html

Hopefully I'll describe everything in more details soon.
